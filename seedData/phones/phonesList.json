ROG Phone 3 takes it further by granting the user PC-like control of the SoC, letting them overclock and increase the throttle limit for unprecedented performance with sustained high frame rate over time, or underclock for longer battery life and more comfortable skin temperature. All of this would not be possible without the efficient “GameCool 3” cooling system that moves heat out of the case for much lower temperatures.",
